    Computes Long-form Yet Another Average Lagging (LongYAAL) as proposed in
    `Better Late Than Never: Evaluation of Latency Metrics for Simultaneous Speech-to-Text
    Translation <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17349>`_.

    This metric uses SoftSegmenter alignment to realign system outputs to reference segments
    before computing latency, making it more robust for long-form speech translation evaluation.

    The key difference from StreamLAAL is the use of SoftSegmenter's more sophisticated
    alignment algorithm that handles long-form audio better. Additionally, LongYAAL is considers
    all output tokens up until the end of the recording. StreamLAAL ignores any output tokens
    emitted after the end of the reference segments.
